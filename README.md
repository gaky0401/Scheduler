# Work Day Scheduler HW5

## Project Information
I added html, css, and javascript to make a functional page
that you can add text into the boxes and then save the contents of the
boxes. You can then delete those contents and refresh the page and the
contents will reappear, because they are saved into local storage.
This was done for each time block during the work day to complete the project.
